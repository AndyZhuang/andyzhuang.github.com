## Good Sentence behind fancy title

As below, it is a paragraph I got from OneAPM CEO HeXiaoYang's article,which is
originally from the book "The hard thing about hard things". 

  As the CEO of a startup, it is crucial to focus on what needs to be right
  rather than worrying about what is wrong. One of the most diffcult challenges
  is keeping your mind in check, you need to be able to move aggressively
  without acting insane. To calm your nerves, find someone you can talk to that
  understands what are you going through, put your ideas, challenges, and fears
  on paper, and focus on where are you going, not what you are trying to avoid.

I think this is really what I need to follow,  and in short just constantly focused on
what is needed to be done,instead of focusing avoiding bad things. Let's make
it happen.  

That is all.
