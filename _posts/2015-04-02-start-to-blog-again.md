##Why to build my startup

"Starting your own company is like standing on the edge looking down an
abyss,chewing glass", although that is what Elon Musk said about building a
startup, I still think there is a tiny magnificent glory of light down in the abyss,which we might call it Dream.

And no one like chewing the glass, but as always, at least it is your own
glass to eat.

I am keep on chewing my glass now, that is it for today.
