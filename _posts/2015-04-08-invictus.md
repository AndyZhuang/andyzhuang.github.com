##Invictus

While checking out the latest update of bitcoins and other Internet currencies, I
found the mechnism of Bitshares seem intriguing. The founding company
called Invictus Innovations, Inc. the I3. The name of the company, is after
Willam Ernest Henley's poem as below.

>Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

>In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

>Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

>It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll.
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul. 

Many stories happened around I3,including changing the name after moved to
HongKong. The original name impressed me the most.
